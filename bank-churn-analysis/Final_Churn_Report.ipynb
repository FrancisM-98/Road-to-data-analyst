    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis investigates the drivers of customer churn for an international bank operating in France, Germany, and Spain. By leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical testing, we identified key behavioral and demographic signals that predict customer departure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Discovery:** We debunked the \"more products is better\" hypothesis, uncovering a **U-shaped risk curve** where customers with exactly 2 products are the most loyal. Customers outside this \"sweet spot\" (1, 3, or 4 products) exhibit significantly higher churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Outcome:** We engineered a composite **\"Danger Score\" (0-4)** that captures the intersection of the key risk factors. This score isolates a high-priority segment of **271 customers** with an **87%+ churn probability**, representing **$32.7 Million** in assets at risk.\n",

    "**The Problem:** Customer churn is a silent profit killer. Acquiring a new customer costs 5-25x more than retaining an existing one. This bank observed a global churn rate of ~20%, but lacks actionable insight into *who* is leaving and *why*.\n",

    "**The Goal:** Move from a passive, reactive stance to a proactive, data-driven retention strategy by:\n",
    "1.  Identifying the key features that differentiate churned customers from retained ones.\n",
    "2.  Engineering a predictive \"risk score\" to flag high-probability churners *before* they leave.\n",
