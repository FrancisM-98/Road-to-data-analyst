# Strategic Intervention Plan: Data-Driven Churn Reduction

**Date:** 2026-02-03
**Subject:** Targeted Retention Strategies for "Danger Score 4" Segment
**Context:** Analysis identifies a critical churn risk (85% probability) among customers who are **German, 45+ years old, and hold 1, 3, or 4 products**.

The following interventions are strictly grounded in our dataset findings, replacing broad assumptions with targeted, measurable pilots.

---

## 1. The "Ecosystem Entry" Initiative (Cross-Selling)
**Target:** *The "Single Product Trap" (NumOfProducts = 1)*
**Objective:** Increase Switching Costs by incentivizing a second product.

**Data-Backed Logic:**
Our statistical analysis (T-Test) proved that customers with **2+ products have a significantly lower churn rate** (~8% vs ~27%). This is a mathematical fact: entanglement reduces churn.

**The Strategy:**
Launch a **"Loss Leader" Bundling Campaign** focused on increasing product hold.
*   **Action:** Offer a high-yield savings account or fee-free credit card *exclusively* to existing single-product checking customers.
*   **Mechanism:** Position this not as a "sale" but as a "loyalty benefit" to increase the perceived value of staying.
*   **Key Metric:** Conversion rate from Single-Product to Multi-Product households.

> **Why it works:** It specifically targets the `NumOfProducts` variable, which is a verified driver of retention. By increasing the "sticky" factor, we directly lower the probability of exit.

## 2. The "Regional Retention Pilot" (Germany)
**Target:** *The "German Market" (Geography = Germany)*
**Objective:** Identify root causes of the 32.4% churn rate through direct data gathering.

**Data-Backed Logic:**
We know *that* German customers are leaving at double the rate of other regions, but the dataset does not tell us *why* (e.g., no NPS or support ticket data). 

**The Strategy:**
Deploy a **90-Day Diagnostic Pilot** in the DACH region.
*   **Action:** Launch a targeted "Exit Survey" and "re-onboarding" campaign for a sample of high-risk German clients.
*   **Mechanism:** Use A/B testing on communication styles (e.g., digital-first vs. personal outreach) to see which reduces churn in a small control group.
*   **Key Metric:** Response rate to exit surveys and reduction in churn within the pilot group.

> **Why it works:** It acknowledges the "German Anomaly" and uses a low-cost pilot to generate the missing qualitative data needed for a long-term solution.

## 3. The "Balance Protection" Program (Wealth Capture)
**Target:** *The "Age Sentinel" (Age 45+)*
**Objective:** Prevent "Yield Churn" among high-balance, mature customers.

**Data-Backed Logic:**
Our analysis confirmed two critical facts:
1.  Customers aged 45+ are the most likely to churn.
2.  Churned customers in this demographic have **higher average balances** ($91k vs $72k).
These are not "dead" accounts; they are high-value customers likely moving their money for better returns.

**The Strategy:**
Implement a **Tenure-Based "Loyalty Interest Rate"**.
*   **Action:** Trigger a specialized interest rate offer for customers aged 45+ with >5 years of tenure.
*   **Mechanism:** "Lock in" these high-balance customers by offering a competitive rate that negates the incentive to switch banks for a marginal gain.
*   **Key Metric:** Retention of AuM (Assets under Management) in the 45-60 age bracket.

> **Why it works:** It directly addresses the financial profile of the churners (high balance). It treats the churn as a financial decision and counters it with a financial incentive.
